# Dinner Party

Suppose you are given a set of n people (with n even) to be seated at a dinner party. The people will be seated along the two sides of a long table.

Half are "hosts", half are "guests". The given function *r(p)* identifies the role of a given person.
As the host, you also know an integer-valued "preference function" *h(p1, p2)* for a pair of people p1, p2. The preference function indicates how much the first person likes the second; it may be negative.

The "score" of a table is determined by the following criteria:

* 1 point for every adjacent pair (seated next to each other) of people with one a host and the other a guest.
* 2 points for every opposite pair (seated across from each other) of people with one a host and the other a guest.
* *h(p1, p2) + h(p2, p1)* points for every adjacent or opposite pair of people p1, p2.
Your job as event organizer is to write a search that will find a "good" table score for a given set of people and preference function.

The data is given to you in the form of an ASCII text file that has the even number n of people on the first line. The first *n/2* people are assumed to be hosts, the rest guests. The preference matrix follows on the remaining lines: rows with values separated by spaces. The people are assumed to be numbered *1..n*. The seats are assumed to be numbered such that the top half of the table has seats *1..n/2* left-to-right, and the bottom half of the table has seats *n/2+1..n* left-to-right; thus seat *n/2* is opposite seat *n*.

The output should be a score, then a series of n rows, each with a person number, then a space, then a seat number.
